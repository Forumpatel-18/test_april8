                to know you better I fell in love with you ü•∞ . And, without
                giving it a second thought jaise hi mujhe realize hua I
                confessed. And since 11th July 2018 my life changed in a good
                way ofc, I cherish all those memories "HUMARA" bus journey,
                skywalk talks, lakshya ke baad doubt solving session ke naam pe
                rukhna, chinese bhel khana, saare festivals sath celebrate
                karna, shamko 6 baje call pe baatein karna, fir phone rakhte hi

                ganta baat karna üòÇ , ....... there is an endless list of our
                memories. I experienced all "MY FIRST" with you. We were kids
                when we started and today we have grown so much. Since day 1 we
                bonded so well and the bond we share I can never ever have this
                with anyone else. You were and are everything to me. Bohot

                We entered the 2nd phase of our life. I was a bit insecure about
                us start mai ki kaise milenge kaise sab phele ki tarah hoga but
                it turned out to be a complete different thing. Everyday meeting
                after college, early morning movies, eating momos ü§§ , herbs and
                cheese maggi of sit down bistro, rishivan mai baith ke khana,
                gharpe chill karna, raatko khabhi khabhi classes ke baad milna.
                Ahhhhhh!!!! still feels like a yesterday thing. Few months were
                really difficult for me and you were there through thick and
                thin. But koi naa voh bhi haste haste pass hogaya. Fir aaya
                MANALI. It was by far the best trip. And all thanks to my travel
                guide. Thenn comes LOCKDOWN , kaise 3 din ek durse ko bina mile
                pagal hone wale log 3 mahina ek durse ko bina dekhe reh liye. It
                was really difficult itne ups and downs the mostly downss but
                still how we managed to get back. Trust me this was the phase
                that gave me confidence if we can survive this phase we can
                handle anything and we even did. I am gladddd you did'nt let me
                go, your one video melted my heart ü•∫ . Again sorry tere 2nd
                Bday pe I could'nt make it.

                Post lockdown phase was beautiful where again we started meeting
                , mini project ke naam pe. Staycations, movies, ghumna firna but
                one thing we missed the most was gharpe milke chill karna. You
                have made my every birthday special but 18th March 2021 was
                really very special at Taj. Yeh saal mai bohot hotels explore
                kiya your birthday at Trident, 1st Jan Grand Hyatt, LemonTree,
                The Lalit kya ameeri thi. Pondicherry was indeed a sweet trip.
                Ups and down toh yaha bhi the but as always resolved it. I was
                really happy and proud seeing you succeeding. One thing I missed
                post lockdown college was my rapido üò¢ , kaam mai busy rehta tha
                naa toh milta hi nai tha college ke baad, but you used to spare
                time for me jhoot wagere bolke. Thankyouuuu üòò

                This year was a bit of a rough patch, where I started taking you

                you who got us back on track, your faith in us, your love

                even more than before it really takes alot of courage to do all
                of these. I promise I wont let you down this time. I promise to
